Neonatal App
---------
This application will have three main components:
1. Modules for storytelling and educational purposes
1. A map with nearby resources 
1. A local database to store contact information

Initial Setup
---------
1. Install node.js
1. Clone repo into a folder on your device by using git clone <this_repository_ssh_or_https_key>
1. Go to a command line prompt and navigate to that folder.
1. Once in folder, type in command line npm install to install all the dependencies and modules in the folder.
1. You can now run the application by using the command `npm start`. This will open up a tab on your browser. Wait until a message appears that says "Tunnel ready." Then, click on the "Tunnel" option in the lower left hand of the browser screen.
Download the Expo Cli app on the phone.
1. If you are using iOS, use the built-in camera app on the phone to scan the QR code. A link will come up asking to open the Expo Cli app. However, for Android devices, the QR code can be scanned from within the Expo Cli app itself. (Note: XCODE's iOS simulator is another option for testing the app. Android simulators are also available.)
